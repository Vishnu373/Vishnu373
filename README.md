Hi, I am Vishnu Vinay üñêÔ∏è

I'm a passionate machine learning engineer with a keen interest on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I leverage my expertise in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and AWS to build and deploy innovative ML solutions.  I'm also fascinated by the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on the field.
